  Just now, as I was searching for the Bash script syntax on how to check if
  a directory exists (for the 63rd time because I have the memory span of an
  agitated Chihuahua) I noticed something interesting. Sentry, the app
  monitoring company, had the top SERP spot.

![Google Search results for "check if dir exists bash"](/assets/sentryoverflow1.png)

[Determine whether a directory exists in Bash]: https://sentry.io/answers/determine-whether-a-directory-exists-in-bash/

I clicked that first result, [Determine whether a directory exists in Bash],
and it took me here:

![Sentry's answer page](/assets/sentryoverflow2.png)

[Answers by Sentry]: https://sentry.io/answers/

When I followed the breadcrumb back to [Answers by Sentry] my first reaction
was "Holy shit! They have questions and answers for over 20 languages,
frameworks, editors, etc. They've been at this a long time!" But then I
expanded the Go section and saw only 3 questions. So either they just started
building out their catalog or they're only targeting some highly trafficked,
basic questions.

Either way, it's a clever move. From the banner on top of the answer page, you
can clearly see that it's a lead generation project.

I'll leave you with a big-picture thought to ponder: Stack Overflow has clearly
lost developer mindshare, the void from Stack Overflow's demise has not yet
entirely been filled by another player, and generative AI has made Q&A datasets
much more valuable and useful.
