  I often think about the people reading my docs in terms of "journeys". Google
  Search drops them into some random page of my site. The content they really
  need often isn't on that exact page; they need to click around to a few other
  pages. Or they're building something complex and the ideas are spread across
  multiple pages. For a GenAI chatbot assistant thingamajigger to be truly
  helpful, it's got to be a companion on that journey. "I can't carry it for
  you, but I can carry you!" It needs to remember your goal, the pages you've
  visited, and the things you previously said. Most important, I think this
  could seriously speed up the time it takes our users to Get Shit Done. Bonus,
  if we can get logs of those chat conversations, we (the docs site
  maintainers) will have a much better idea about what kinds of journeys our
  users are actually going on. The video below is a proof-of-concept that
  stateful docs site assistants are possible.
